# IPL Data Analysis (2008–2017)

This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on Indian Premier League (IPL) match statistics from 2008 to 2017 to uncover trends, patterns, and key insights related to teams, players, venues, and match outcomes.

---

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze historical IPL data and extract meaningful insights such as:
- Team performance trends across seasons
- Impact of toss decisions on match outcomes
- Player-level performance analysis
- Venue-wise match statistics
- Overall tournament patterns

This project demonstrates strong fundamentals in **data cleaning, analysis, and visualization** using Python.

---

## Tech Stack

- Python
- NumPy
- pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Dataset

The dataset contains IPL match-level statistics till the 2017 season, including:
- Match details (teams, venue, season)
- Toss and match results
- Player and team performance metrics

> Dataset is sourced from publicly available IPL data repositories.

---

## Analysis Performed

### Team Analysis
- Total matches played and won by each team
- Season-wise team performance
- Win percentage comparison

### Toss Impact
- Toss decision vs match result analysis
- Advantage of batting first vs fielding first

### Player Insights
- Top run scorers
- Leading wicket takers
- Consistent performers across seasons

### Venue Analysis
- Matches played at different venues
- Home-ground advantage trends

### Visual Exploration
- Bar charts, count plots, box plots
- Heatmaps for correlation analysis
- Season-wise performance trends

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Arrush5/EDA_IPL_Analysis_till_2017-Stats.git
cd EDA_IPL_Analysis_till_2017-Stats

2. Install required libraries:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter

---

## How to Run
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook: jupyter notebook
2. Open the IPL EDA notebook and run the cells sequentially to view the analysis and visualizations.

---

## Key Insights
- Certain teams consistently dominated across multiple seasons.
- Toss decisions showed a measurable influence on match outcomes.
- Some venues favored batting-first strategies.
- A small group of players contributed significantly to team success.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Extend analysis to IPL seasons beyond 2017
- Add interactive visualizations using Plotly or Streamlit
- Apply machine learning models for match outcome prediction
- Perform advanced player impact analysis
